## Random Nordic Snippet

This single-page application is a random fact generator for selecting a random Nordic fact. 
At the top of the application is a navigation bar in which the countries can be toggled to be included or excluded by a click from the generator.

Once selected the fact will be displayed within the centre of the page. Once a new fact is generated the past three facts will then be displayed below the current fact and can be looked at again by hovering the mouse of them.

These facts can be shared on social media with UI implemented from react-share.<br/>
